## About

   The CountET is a game made for the Swift Student Challenge (WWDC23) that gives children greater familiarity with sum, the first operation we learned at school and the one that will introduce us to all the others. The game aims to make people see mathematics not as a monster that must be faced, but as a fun challenge that we are able to pass.
